<sup>This screenshot is a mockup, editor still a prototype.</sup>

A room based map editor for use in PlayStation (PSX/PSone) homebrew games made with JavaScript.

# About
The maps generated by this editor are separated into individual rooms, with set transition points that will switch the rendered area, allowing larger playable maps in your games.

# How to use it in your own games
For now, we're starting the development of the editor, with the code to render and manage levels to be developed at a later date when the editor is at least minimally functional.
